The Conservatives still have considerable sway as the largest opposition party in a minority government, so Poilievre still regularly appears in the Canadian news.\n\nIt is worth adding that Poilievre did lose his seat in addition to the Conservatives losing the election, but he won a seat in a special election after a member of his party in the safest riding in the country stepped aside for him.",

Its flight characteristics, weaponry, and electronic warfare equipment were specifically tailored to fight against a Russian invasion. Its entire concept of operations assumed limited help from outside, since Sweden was not a part of NATO until very recently. \n\n\nThis is exactly the kind of fight that Ukraine is in right now, and as much as I love the F-16, it’s just too much of a runway queen. If Ukraine can get some Gripens in the air soon, maybe even Meteor missiles, it would be a fantastic asset against these awful glide bomb campaigns.",

The need to be rugged, adaptable, fly from makeshift airfields and capable of maintenance from less technical staff is exactly what Ukraine needs.  \n\n\nThe more important comparison isn't Gripen vs F35 but Gripen vs Su and MiG, in which case Su should come out on top",

I met him at the 10 Year Class Reunion in 2018 and he said that his nipples were still purple from all of those titty twisters I gave him. We got emotional and I apologized to him and he accepted it gracefully and hugged me.",

The memory I mentioned is of a line of nanny candidates standing in our house, and my mom telling me to pick the one I liked. I remember pointing at some poor girl like she was a toy on a shelf.\n\nWhen I was younger, I had a horrible relationship with my mom. I made her cry very often as a child. I remember her crying when I told her I didn’t like a Christmas present she gave me. Another time, after we’d had a fight, she tried to apologize and gave me something (I don’t remember what it was—maybe a snack), and I threw it on the floor in front of her. I was a horrible child, and I still feel bad about it.",

I was once shopping with my friend and my mom came in the same store and she was so excited to see me. We didn’t have a lot of visitation, it was like every other weekend. She had this big smile on her face and I just pretended not to know her. I grabbed my friend and ran in the next aisle and my mom came around thinking I didn’t see her and then I ran away laughing. Awful, awful, awful. It kills me and I’m 33 now. I always answer the phone when she calls now. Dinner with her every birthday and Mother’s Day. Text her randomly to tell her I love her, or how proud I am to be her daughter or grateful we have each other. I was definitely in foster care for a reason, we didn’t have the best childhood and my mom was a single mom and there was a lot of trauma involved. But still, I know that broke her heart that day. \n\nAnd the other one is when I was 13, a new foster kid moved in our house he was like 8 years old. I had to babysit him so I played a prank on him that a bear was outside. I ran around the house panting and hyperventilating asking if he could hear that or see that. He started crying and I realized I scared him so I stopped but looking back, I always wondered how I didn’t realize what this kid was coming from. Foster homes were always normal to me, I learned to cope with it but he was just a kid.",

But they all slowly started developing real feelings for me and I would tell them to stop telling me the L word (I love you) but they just wouldn't stop. It kept going on until one day I was gonna send a TikTok to all of them and I accidentally added them in the same group. It was a post that said \"Send this to someone you wanna make out with\". That's how they found out lmao I felt like horrible.",

She could barely hold a job and constantly had issues with her family. I didn't necessarily want to end the relationship because truthfully I didn't wanna deal with it as badly as I wanted out. Sex had greatly dwindled between us. When I found out a friend had an attraction to me and gave me attention I felt I had been missing, I gave in and slept with my friend. The other one was before the previously mentioned relationship. Before that relationship I had multiple failed relationships. Many of which never lasted more than a month or two. One cheated on me. The others parents didn't approve of us dating and forbid their daughter from dating me. So after just a few months with this new gal I had sort of mentally prepared for the relationship to end. A friend recently got out of a relationship and wanted to fool around. I said fuck it, this relationship is gonna end soon anyway and I am attracted to my friend. Little did my ass know that the relationship would go on for another year and a half and ended when my friend came forward about me cheating to my then girlfriend. We tried to work on the relationship but there just wasn't any moving on from what I did so I told her it's time to move on from me because it's clear that we aren't going to get any better. Learned a lot about how actions can genuinely hurt someone. Took me ruining two relationships to figure that out but it was very eye opening and really forced myself to work on being better.",

Shitty ? Yes I know. I mean no one liked her she was weird and unapproachable.  She had like a bad home life and her relationship with her mum sucked, she used to cut herself in school till the teachers sent her to a councilor. But I did out of peer pressure and I don't know what else. So we talked, gave pet names. She took my hoodie and every night sent photos of her wearing it to me. She was uhh weirdly very into me, like not just romantic but like sexually too. She'd talk about intimacy together and how she wished we were together in the open or something. Well unfortunately she found out and like completely freaked out, I'm talking crying, screaming full crash out infront of the whole school. I mean I feel pretty bad for what I did, she really acted like my gf, like getting me cookies and baking for me, and messaging me daily, hell even sent nudes when she was feeling like it.

They make your heart race, your head spin, you get butterflies and struggle to sleep, you're always checking your phone for a text from that person, looking for that little dopamine hit of attention.\n\nA lot of people mistake this for love, and think that when this phase dies or loses its intensity/momentum, they've lost interest or fallen out of love. \n\nIn my experience, love itself is calm. It is steady, and stable, and comforting. Infatuation and lust can co-exist with love, and often they are the most sustainable when they do. But love is the calm part. It's the part that is happy grocery shopping together, baking bread, laughing at cat videos, sitting in silence. It's the part that volunteers to do the laundry because you know they hate folding clothes - you also hate folding clothes but you love them more than you hate it. \n\nInfatuation and lust are the drive for good, short term experiences.   \nLove is the drive for good, long-term partnership.  \nAgain, the two can co-exist, and often do. But they are ultimately still separate things. \n\nThat's my take, at least.",

If making her happy makes me happy. \n\nIn the past, I've was thinking \"I'd probably wait two years to wed her if things go well for two years. Also I would put a condom to make sure I don't get aids till I know its safe.\" It has value, but if you go in a space of trust, worth and love for yourself...\n\nI realized that, wait a minute, I've known her for five minutes and if she asked me to wed her I'd say yeah, absolutely, no doubt about it, wanna do it next week?\n\nI've met three girls like this in my entire life. Out of the thousands and thousands of people I saw, its those three.\n\nI have fucked the relationship with these three girls because I was unable to reciprocate the love they did give me, because my mother raised me with blame, shame, rejection, denial and hatred. So even thought I was all-in consciously, I was not subconsciouly because I had a subconscious belief that I was unworthy, unlovable, and that love meant getting hurt.\n\nSo they taught me life lessons but at such at high price, it still makes me sad to this day, and I still love every single one of them even thought they are not in my vicinity no more.\n\nAnd sometimes I cry because im like... yeah you played your cards flawlessly, yeah you did not feel loved, but if you would have just asked me and made it patiently safe to answer... I would have flooded your life with the love of a man that's eternal and that would carve oceans for you.\n\nBut technically speaking it was me and my problems and they were in \"the right\" but who cares about right or wrong its all bs. \n\nAlso it gives an insight into humanity, because I was unable to love them not because I didn't.\n\nAnd when she left in silence after saying the sweetest thing to me and offering herself to me, and I just walked back and went into a freeze response... and I was like, go talk to her, and I coudln't because I was afraid to look ridiculous and be rejected.\n\nAnd I think that's why they are called girlfriends. Because if I was my own best friend at the time, and I would have walked past the gate of fear, and said to myself you know what fuck it, imma be vulnerable and intimate and tell her how I feel about her and show her and make her feel it. And even if I look ridiculous, and im against all odds, I will do it.\n\nThe regret so intense I still feel.\n\nMy spiritual mistress told me that the stupid dog in spaceball was the most accurate depiction of being your own best friend. I had to think it over for a while because... I was like, hes not cool. Actually, he's in a movie where every single character is ridiculous, and -he- stands out for being way more painfully ridiculous. So maybe thats what it is to be your own best friend, to believe in yourself no matter what.",

Until I got diagnosed by my gastro with a SIBO tri-gas test, she had me tested for all sorts of diseases because I had developed so many food intolerances and dealt with constant pain, gas, and constipation that made it difficult to eat at all. Most vegetables as well as wheat, dairy, and some meats became off-limits due to the insane bloating and pain they gave me. I relied heavily on zucchini, rice, and chicken with my meals as symptoms worsened and made it impossible to tolerate more and more foods. I felt like I was starving no matter how much I ate, and struggled to stay over 100 lbs. \n\nAfter treatment with metronidazole and rifaximin, I was finally able to eat normally again. Being able to eat wheat and dairy again without intense pain and bloating has allowed me to put on a little more weight, and made eating in general a lot simpler. My vitamin D levels went from deficient to 55 ng/mL in two months after the antibiotics; I had been supplementing for years and could not get myself in a healthy range. My gastro was convinced I had a much more serious illness because of how bad my malabsorption was, but it seems like it was all an overgrowth of methanogenic archaea after all.",

For example, everyone should see a spike in hydrogen as the sugar reaches the bacteria-laden large intestine, but an earlier rise suggests an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine. Meanwhile, methane levels don’t really go down with the absence of food. Methanogens can wait and ferment for a long time without food present, so seeing a high baseline methane level on the “blank” sample before ingesting the lactulose suggests methane overgrowth. \n\nI had a baseline methane concentration of about 12 ppm, with the “abnormal” cutoff being 10 ppm. Methane above 10 ppm at any point means  methanogen overgrowth. My methane concentration rose over the entire 120 minutes, while my hydrogen only rose after the 90-minute mark (normal, because that’s when it enters the large intestine). Hydrogen sulfide remained low throughout. Since methanogens technically feed on hydrogen produced by bacteria, treatment involves two antibiotics (neomycin or metronidazole and rifaximin) to target both archaea and bacteria. Hydrogen SIBO is more common, and can be treated with rifaximin alone. Many struggle to keep the condition from returning after treatment, but it’s always good to get diagnosed to rule out more serious illnesses.",

I learned through experience that many doctors themselves are unaware of the condition or how to treat it, so it helps to approach things with a solid background. \n\nCase in point, the same gastro that ordered the test was unaware that I’d need a second antibiotic to deal with the archaea.

The randomness of the supplied current is the key to the desired output of this engine.\n\nWould you argue that a car engine is driven by pressure not gasoline? The engine converts chamber pressure to rotational energy, that chamber pressure just happens to come from combustion and that combustion happens to come from burning gasoline. But we all accept that car engines run on gas because that is the type of fuel we use to acheive the best results from gas engines.\n\nE: Also just to be clear. An engine being powered by a random voltage is a new thing.

In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254625000808\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nStudy finds stronger fitness in countries with greater gender equality\n\nA new study published in the Journal of Sport and Health Science provides evidence that cardiorespiratory fitness tends to be higher in countries with greater gender equality and higher levels of human development. The findings suggest that social conditions and national policies may shape people’s access to physical activity and their ability to maintain physical health.\n\nThe final dataset included over 119,000 adults, with roughly 58 percent men and 42 percent women. The participants came from a diverse group of countries including the United States, Brazil, Germany, China, and Japan. Each study was matched with the relevant Human Development Index and Gender Inequality Index scores for the country and year in which data were collected.\n\nThe researchers found that fitness tends to decrease with age and that, **on average, women had lower VO2peak values than men. However, when comparing countries, they noticed a pattern: adults in countries with higher levels of human development and lower levels of gender inequality had higher fitness levels**.\n\nThe relationship between development and fitness was especially pronounced among women. Women living in countries with high human development scores had higher VO2peak levels across all age groups. For men, this trend was mainly observed in those under 40 years old. This suggests that women may benefit more from living in supportive and equitable societies when it comes to maintaining physical fitness.\n\nA similar pattern emerged when looking at gender inequality. In countries with less gender inequality, both men and women had higher cardiorespiratory fitness, but the effect was again stronger for women. The difference was most notable among women under 40. Young women living in countries with low gender inequality had fitness levels that were on average 6.5 mL/kg/min higher than those in countries with high gender inequality. This difference is large enough to matter for health, as even small increases in VO2peak are linked with reduced risks of chronic disease and early death.\n\n**These results suggest that policies and social structures that promote equality and development may indirectly support better health by enabling more people, especially women, to engage in regular and vigorous physical activity**.",

                "body": "I'll just quote the introduction of *The Enigma of the Aerofoil* (Bloor, 2011), a thorough history of the early debates about lift theory:\n\n&gt;The practical problem of building machines that can be flown, that is, the problem of “mechanical” or “artificial” flight, was solved in the final years of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth century. In the 1890s Otto Lilienthal in Germany successfully built and flew what we today would call hang gliders. From 1903 to 1905 the Wright brothers in the United States showed that sustained and controlled powered flight was possible and practical. What had long been called the \"secret\" of flight was now no longer a secret. But not all of the secret was revealed. Some parts of it remained hidden, and indeed, some parts are still hidden today. The practical successes of the pioneer aviators still left unanswered the question of how a wing generated the lift forces that were necessary for flight. The pioneers mostly worked by trial and error. Some had experimented with models and taken measurements of lift and drag (the air resistance opposing the motion), but the measurements were sparse and unreliable. No deeper theoretical understanding had prompted or significantly informed the early successes of the pioneers, nor had theory kept pace with the growth of practical under standing. The action of the air on the wing remained an enigma.\n\nIn a nutshell: several pioneers, particularly [Horatio Frederick Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Frederick_Phillips), [Otto Lilienthal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Lilienthal), and [Octave Chanute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave_Chanute) did work on aerofoil profiles. Phillips, the promoter of the doomed \"Venetian blinds\" aircraft style, patented aerofoil designs and build a wind tunnel to test them. His aerofoils were cambered. For Anderson (1998):\n\n&gt;His designs were the first truly modem airfoils, and his rationale for the basic design principle was sound. He recognized that when the flow moved over the curved upper surface of the airfoil, the pressure would decrease; hence the lifting action of the airfoil was due to a combination of the lower pressure exerted on the upper surface and the higher pressure exerted on the lower surface.\n\nSo here we have, in the 1880s, cambered aerofoils tested in a wind tunnel. But this was completely empirical, and it didn't help Phillips to make his Venetian blinds airborne. Otto Lilienthal also carried out experiments and collected data on cambered aerofoils, but without a wind tunnel. By the late 19th century, those ideas were in the air (so to speak), and pioneers, including the Wrights, worked on the right direction concerning aerofoil profiles. They made progress in *applied* aerodynamics that worked. What they lacked was a theoretical, mathematical expression of the forces at play, a new science of aerodynamics that was developing in parallel. In fact, for a while, the \"practical men\", those who did put machines in the air, seem to have resented, or at least been skeptical of the musings of the \"slide-rule scientists\". C.G. Grey, editor of the magazine *The Aeroplane*, wrote in 1917 (cited by Bloor, 2011): \n\n&gt;Never mind what the scientists calculate. Trust the man who guesses, and guesses right.\n\nWW1 aircrafts were thus designed without the benefits of theoretical aerodynamics. Anderson speculates that the German engineers responsible for the Fokker D-VII may have had access to the data of Ludwig Prandtl's laboratory at Gottingen, a hotbed of aerodynamics (see the [Lanchester–Prandtl lifting-line theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting-line_theory)). But otherwise, it was only in the 1920s that aircraft design started integrating the aerodynamics theories developed in Britain and Germany, causing something of a \"culture shock\" in an industry that had been confidently relying on empiricism until now.\n\n**Sources**\n\n\n* Anderson, John David.

Nadar, an aeronaut enthusiast, became convinced that balloons were a dead end and that the future of aerial locomotion was the heavier-than-air. He wrote a long manifesto that [started as follows](https://www.retronews.fr/journal/memorial-de-la-loire-et-de-la-haute-loire/14-septembre-1863/3/2984349b-05c7-4bf3-80dc-cf3122faf25d):\n\n&gt;To fight against air, you have to be specifically heavier than air. Anything that is not absurd is possible. Anything that is possible will be done. What has killed balloon navigation in the eighty years we have been trying to achieve it is balloons themselves. In other words, trying to fight against air by being lighter than air is madness.\n\nNadar's idea of an heavier-than-air was not an airplane-looking vehicle though, but a kind of multi-propeller helicopter imagined by La Landelle, basically a [ship with a bunch of propellers on the top](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Joseph_Gabriel_de_La_Landelle#/media/Fichier:Helicopter_of_de_La_Landelle.JPG). Fans of Jules Verne (a member of the *Société*) will recognize the [ship from *Robur the Conqueror*](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6512278z/f68.item). The propeller system was designed by [Gustave de Ponton d'Amécourt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_de_Ponton_d%27Am%C3%A9court) and Nadar did public demonstrations of a [toy prototype](https://expositions.bnf.fr/les-nadar/grand/nad_282.php) using what he called his \"dear propeller\". The *Société d'encouragement* that he founded with La Landelle attracted some big names in science and letters, and he also started a magazine, *L'Aéronaute*. \n\nInventors sent to the *Société* projects like this [\"aerial fish\"](https://journals.openedition.org/insitu/docannexe/image/16768/img-6-small580.jpg) or this [three-masts ballon-ship](https://journals.openedition.org/insitu/docannexe/image/16768/img-8-small580.jpg) (note the \"lunatics\" on the right). Nadar tried to raise funds for the *Société* by flying a big balloon called *Le Géant* that crashed twice, seriously injuring him and his wife. There were more successful trials but Nadar went in debt so he had to give up. Nadar was ruined after the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 and resumed his photographer career. He still believed in the future of the \"heavier-than-air\" though: Clément Ader [wrote to him on 12 October 1890](https://books.google.fr/books?id=B6gAEQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) to tell him of the 50-m flight of his [\"avion\" *Eole*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ader_%C3%89ole). In July 1909, the 89-year-old Nadar sent Louis Blériot a telegram after the successful crossing of the Channel ([*Le Figaro*, 28 July 1909](https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-figaro/28-juillet-1909/4/a869d557-46c3-428e-a6e4-12ab294d44b4?)):\n\n&gt;Heartfelt gratitude for the joy your triumph has brought to the antediluvian of ‘heavier than air’, before his eighty-nine years are laid to rest. \n\n* Jestaz, Juliette. ‘Soutenir l’aérostation pour mieux la tuer.

In 1880s through the first decade of the 20th century, scientists believed in evolution but had largely abandoned natural selection.  This was because it had been mathematically shown that blended inheritance would result in small mutations being swamped out.  Many scientists had moved back to some sort of theory where evolution made animals more perfect over time.  The short length of time for adaptations to flight would not have been mainstream, but there were some biologists who believed that Lord Kelvin was right about the age of the earth, and thus had accelerated timelines for evolution.\n\nWhat’s funny is that Rutherford would discover heat from radiation that same year which would invalidate Kelvin’s age of the earth.  And de Vries at the same time was reinventing Mendelian genetics.  Newcomb really could not catch a break about where the future of science and engineering was going.",

This seemed like not enough time for evolution to have produced life as we know it.  This changed when Rutherford figured out radioactivity, which he figured could be heating the earth from the inside, making it likely much older, so plenty of time for evolution to have produced us.  (There's a great old story of Rutherford presenting his results in public and seeing old Lord Kelvin in the audience, whom he rightly guessed wouldn't take kindly to being told he was wrong.  Thinking quickly, Rutherford said 'Lord Kelvin calculated the age of the earth at no more than 100 million years old *unless* some other mechanism is keeping it hot inside.  Here is that mechanism'.  Kelvin, having been given credit for prescience, just nodded in agreement.  That's how you step over land mines, kids.)\n\nApparently it's also true that Darwin had the answer for blending inheritance on his desk when he was pondering how evolution could work without traits coming in discreet packages that don't just average out between generations.  It was a copy of a paper by Mendel which contained all Darwin needed to know about 'genes' and how they get passed down, but Darwin either didn't read it or didn't understand the implications of Mendel's work.",

        "body": "A lot of people are probably used to the \"Shaken, not stirred\" line from the movies, but in some ways it's a simplification of a bit in the first novel, *Casino Royale*:\n\n&gt; 'A dry martini,' he said. 'One. In a deep champagne goblet.'\n\n&gt; 'Oui, monsieur.'\n\n&gt; 'Just a moment. Three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon-peel. Got it?'\n\nAnd then a few paragraphs later, he explains that order to Leiter:\n\n&gt; 'When I'm... er... concentrating,' he explained, 'I never have more than one drink before dinner. But I do like that one to be large and very strong and very cold and very well-made. I hate small portions of anything, particularly when they taste bad. This drink's my own invention. I'm going to patent it when I can think of a good name.'\n\nThe reality is that that order is just a fairly stiff drink that will get him a light buzz, but won't completely take him out of the game (pun somewhat intended). There's some speculation about the shaking vs stirring being about making sure that the drink is (in Bond's own words) \"very cold\" because a drink will cool faster in a shaker than it will by stirring.\n\nHe also makes a further statement after taking his first sip a little further down the page:\n\n&gt; 'Excellent,' he said to the barman, 'but if you can get a vodka made with grain instead of potatoes, you will find it still better.'\n\n&gt; 'Mais n'enculons pas des mouches.'\n\nThat last bit literally translates as \"But we're not fucking flies\"—this is \"fucking\" as a verb, not an adjective—and is basically a rude way of saying \"We're not splitting hairs.\" It shows both that Bond has enough taste to have a preference for a lighter-flavored vodka that would pair well with the flavor of the gin and vermouth, but also that he has some pragmatism about just taking whatever vodka is offered. There's far less overall variation in flavor for vodkas as compared to gin (heavy on botanicals) and Kina Lillet (which is not actually vermouth, but is also based on grape and herb flavors).\n\nAs far as the broader characterization, you have to keep in mind that since this is the first novel, Bond isn't given a lot of background, so it's hard to pin down that this is related to his upbringing in any way. At this point, the character isn't established as having gone to Eton or having grown up an orphan in the care of the government. All we know is that he works in military intelligence.\n\nFleming was himself a Naval Intelligence officer and while elements of the character are based on people he met through that role, several elements are just Fleming's own personal preferences. That said, the recipe for this particular drink supposedly comes from Ivar Bryce, a British intelligence officer and friend of Fleming who went on to own a large newspaper syndicate in the US and Canada. Per Bryce's book *You Only Live Once: Memories of Ian Fleming*, Fleming inscribed a copy of *Casino Royale* with:\n\n&gt; For Ivar, who mixed the first Vesper and said the good word.\n\nAnyway, if you are interested in learning more about the people who inspired the character, I'd recommend *Ian Fleming's Commandos: The Story of the Legendary 30 Assault Unit*. Fleming himself proposed and created 30 Assault Unit in WWII and despite the \"assault\" name also did a lot of intelligence work deep behind enemy lines.\n_______\nQuoted portions from pp. 43-44 of the 2012 Thomas &amp; Mercer edition.\n____\nEditing to add: In the film *Casino Royale*, he both orders the Vesper specifically as shaken over ice at one point, but at another point he orders a martini and when asked for shaken or stirred replies, \"Do I look like I give a damn?\" That's much more straightforward trying to show that he's shifting back to some of his loose cannon tendencies displayed earlier in the film after losing out of the poker game. Note that the film Bond and the literary Bond don't line up perfectly, and the film Bond isn't always characterized the same between actors and eras. *Casino Royale* is probably the closest to the original novel (either that or *From Russia with Love*) and was a deliberate attempt to try to ground the character again after the Pierce Brosnan films got increasingly wild. Watch *Die Another Day* and then *Casino Royale* and you might be surprised that Brosnan and Craig are playing the same character in the same universe.\n\nAlso of note is that in the film of *You Only Live Twice*, Sean Connery's Bond is actually offered martinis that are stirred and he accepts them as \"Perfect.\" As I said, even the films aren't always consistent.",

It's not entirely wrong, just overblown.\n\nSure, shaking is a more violent motion and is more likely to break off little chips from the ice, but there are so many other variables at play that can impact the diluting effects of cooling a drink with ice:\n\n* The way the ice is stored, especially at bars, can result in varying amounts of surface water already on the ice; an ice well getting constantly opened might struggle to keep the ice full solid. Heating through a phase transition takes a lot more energy than it otherwise would if you stayed within a certain phase (i.e. all solid or all liquid), so I won't really take the starting temp as otherwise having too much of a dillutive effect.\n* The shape of the ice will impact both how much surface area contacts the drink and how many edges there are that could get more easily chipped than smoother surfaces and curves.\n* For a given temperature of drink, roughly the same amount of dilution should occur between shaking and stirring (potential ice chips aside) because the same amount of thermal energy is being transferred from the drink to the ice. Note that I talk about Bond potentially wanting shaking because it will cool faster *as a function of the (presumably busy) bartender's time* who might not otherwise take enough time while stirring; this is not to say that less ice would come out as liquid water because you cooled it faster.\n\nI've seen estimates on dilution from shaking vs. stirring as an increase of anywhere from 5-15% over the same drink stirred, but when you consider that stirring alone might be 40-60% to begin with, it's not a huge increase. \n\nAnd ultimately, he's still getting a lot of alcohol there. Gordon's would've been 48% abv at the time (it's since been reformulated down to 40%), vodka very well may have been 50% (40% has been the standard minimum in most countries to be called vodka for over a century, but 50% was a fairly common strength in the 1960s), and Kina Lillet was 17%. Do the math on that and you get a pre-ice concentration of about 36% abv.",

Note that you always toss the heads (what comes before the ethanol) because it can kill you. [Here's a decent primer on the process of vodka production](https://www.rabbitholedistillery.com/blogs/bourbon-101/how-vodka-is-made), but you're basically just trying to distill to the highest purity you can and then adding water back in to get it to a drinkable alcohol concentration of usually 40%/80 proof—you *can* drink 190 proof alcohol but good luck keeping it down.\n* Wait... 190 proof? Why not 200? Well, you can only distill ethanol to a certain purity in the first place, and 95.5-96% is the limit. This is because of the chemistry of water and ethanol at earth-atmospheric pressure making them form what's called an azeotrope, which is a mixture that has the same composition as both a liquid and a vapor (which means it can't be separated by distillation). If you were able to distill at much lower pressures it wouldn't be a problem, but here we are.\n* Some makers actually deliberately leave their vodkas less-distilled and less-filtered specifically so that they carry some of their flavors forward into the final product and they have a marketable unique quality. Grey Goose, for example, makes a [point of only distilling once](https://www.greygoose.com/stories/vodka-essentials/vodka-myths.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqPgf1OYGAv6awc2WqsFqfqkhsdSrpPEeA4O2MgyjCZ_fSzR85U) to keep the wheat flavors. Some also do it because they're lazy. I've seen it alleged, but can't personally confirm, that the standards in Russia call for vodka to be distilled three times to be called vodka, and some Russian makers will deliberately never do a fourth distillation.\n* Not pertinent to grain vs. potato, but I did already mention that making vodka involves adding water back into a higher-proof ethanol distillate. Obviously any impurities in that water will also impact the flavor. A number of makers talk about using things like \"natural spring water,\" which is never going to be pure. Only distilled water is truly flavorless, and even things labeled \"purified drinking water\" generally have minerals added back in for flavor.\n\nIn short, it's possible to have very neutral-tasting vodka that's easily masked by other flavors, but it's never going to be chemically perfect and even some high-end vodkas just aren't aiming for true neutral and will let some flavor of the mash bill through to the final product.",

When it was published in 1965 only three Bond films had been released: *Dr No*, *From Russia with Love* and *Goldfinger*. *Thunderball* would come out that same year.\n\nIn the section on cocktails in the chapter simply titled **DRINK**, Amis makes two notes on the make up of Bond's Martini and the \"full-dress, all out version\", the Vesper:\n\n&gt; i) The original recipe calls for Kina Lillet in place of Lillet vermouth. The former is flavoured with quinine and would be very nasty in a Martini. Our founder slipped up here. If Lillet vermouth isn't available specify Martini Rossi dry. Noilly Prat is good for many purposes, but not for Martinis.\n\nA quick Google search reveals Kina Lillet is no longer produced. According to [*Difford's guide*](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au) it was the predecessor to the renamed Lillet Blanc - a reformulation in 1986 which removed the quinine, Kina being a French word for quinine. Even though the change would have made the Lillet less bitter, Amis' dismissal of Noily Prat suggests he'd find the very similar tasting Lillet Blanc to still be a mistake in a martini.\n\n&gt;ii) Make sure the barman is very ignorant, or very deferential, or very both before talking about vodka bases. Potato vodka is the equivalent of poteen, or bath-tub gin, and getting hold of a bottle of it through ordinary commercial channels wouldn't be easy even on the far side of the Iron Curtain. (The Viking Press, 1965, p17)\n\nThis suggests that in the Dr No passage, Bond is telling the bartender that he knows he is substituting bootleg liquor but doesn't care, while telling the reader Bond has drunk enough of both cheap booze and the good stuff to tell the difference.\n\nWhile some of this is second hand commentary, I'd like to think that as a good friend of Flemming, Amis might have some insight into the writing, intention and possible goofs of the books.",

As stated in my original reply, the recipe was something that one of Fleming's fellows concocted (and presumably regularly drank). Odds are good that Fleming writes it as Bryce ordered it; who better would know what kind of drink an intelligence officer would order than an actual intelligence officer?\n2. Bottom-shelf/rail liquors are generally very consistently produced with little variation between bottles, picked for being cheap and not needing to stand out as a sipping liquor (since they're about to be mixed with other flavors), and generally widely available. You might not drink Gordon's neat, but odds are good that your local bar has it.\n\nAs I mention elsewhere in the thread, gin can vary much more widely in flavor (both the flavors themselves and the strength of that flavor) compared to the variation commonly found in vodka. So it's not unusual that a seasoned cocktail drinker—especially one who mentions wanting to patent the specific recipe for their favorite drink, as Bond does in *Casino Royale*—would specify a particular and common brand of gin with a known flavor while being more or less okay with whatever rail vodka is on hand.\n\nTo give a comparison for another liquor, specifying a particular rail gin for your martini would be no different than specifying that you want an old fashioned made with Jim Beam (a bourbon with a sweeter, corn-based flavor) or Old Overholt (a rye with a spicier and drier flavor). They're both cheap whiskeys, but those two old fashioneds would taste quite different. If it were Felix Leiter's drink, a Vesper might have been Americanized as an old fashioned made from Old Overholt, honey, and Peychaud's bitters served with a twist of grapefruit peel and then Leiter calling the waiter back to specify that clover honey's fine but orange blossom honey would really drive it home. (Or maybe we're taking the Jeffrey Wright version of Felix Leiter, who we learn in *No Time to Die* is from Milwaukee, and he calls for the Wisconsin classic: Korbel brandy!)",

        "body": "I know a bit about one aspect of this! First time trying to answer a question here, so I'll do my best to follow the rules.\n\nI have a Master's in Library Science and one area I studied was the history of American public libraries. Men like Andrew Carnegie loom large in the popular history of libraries as an institution. As you state, Carnegie (and many of his peers) were indeed greatly invested in public works... But it would be a mistake to approach their motives in a vacuum, and it's equally mistaken to take their *own words* at face value. As I learned during my research, Carnegie had perhaps three main motives for his philanthropic works.\n\nOne was indeed the simple desire to do good. Carnegie's personal writings show a conscientious person, a person who wanted to contribute to what he saw as a strong and healthy social order. We should keep in mind though that his values were not necessarily our values! He believed strongly in ideas of social class and intrinsic human capability. He thought capitalism and traditional Western values were the only solid foundation for a virtuous and prosperous civilization, and his philanthropy was aimed toward promoting them.\n\nTwo (and in my opinion the most important) was a purely profit-driven motive. Carnegie constantly struggled with difficulty hiring and retaining skilled, reliable workers. Those workers inclined toward the kinds of industrial labor his enterprises were built upon were also the least likely to be educated. Carnegie's investment in public libraries was a very deliberate effort to better-educate the common folk so that *he would have smarter workers*, and so that *he didn't have to pay to educate them*. (His thoughts on temperance tie in here, drunk workers are *bad for business*.) Carnegie also feared socialists, anarchists, and any form of political/social revolution/reform. He very much wanted the rich and powerful to *stay* rich and powerful. He thought that a population educated on the Western philosophical (and economic-theoretical) canon would be inoculated against socialism and accept, as he had, the moral and practical rightness of a Capitalist society.\n\nFinally, Carnegie's philanthropy (and specifically his frequent statements toward the end of his life that a rich man's *obligation* is to give away money) was a very calculated and deliberate effort to rehabilitate his image. The Homestead strike and his many other anti-union, anti-labor efforts had done real damage to his image, and he wanted to be remembered well. He feared being hated almost as much as he feared being forgotten.\n\nIn summary, Carnegie's motives were a lot more complicated than \"books are great, everyone should have books!\" I don't think any part of his motives make him a monster - I think they make him human. I think that we should probably think about present-day philanthropists (and also those who choose *not* to be philanthropists) the same way.\n\nSome sources follow (less comprehensive than I had before I lost a lot of my old schoolwork/schoolbooks!)\n\n**On Carnegie's efforts to rehabilitate his image through philanthropy:**  \nJohn H.

Following the life of Richard Henry Wooten, a prominent businessman in Milledgeville, Georgia. He was involved in politics, the Kiwanis club, the masons, a military college alumnae association, a theatre group, building the chamber of commerce. He started a bicycle club, a fishing and hunting club, a couple of Methodist related organizations. He was heavily involved in business charity events organized with other business owners. Usually around the holidays or cute little festivals, but also signed petitions to let workers off once a week early in the summertimes. Every-time they quoted him for the political, you can tell he wanted to grow Milledgeville. He was rabid for building factories, promoting the telephone and electric companies. You can tell there is a running theme of building up the community through capitalism. And he was very much a capitalist. He didn’t seem unusual for the culture at the time among the upper crust citizens. He clearly took some of the charity event ideas from his mother, and one of my ancestors who ran a hat shop around the same time clearly took to some of those ideas as well. \nNow these folks didn’t have the same money as Carnegie, but there does seem to be more of a focus on community building and charity than there is currently by the more well off citizens.",

Community boosters were a bit different than philanthropists. Building the community tended to come from a sense of your well-being being intertwined with your community. Today, the function that the community boosters provided has mostly been taken over by developers, corporations(which have no connection to community), and politicians (which may be serving the national party). This transition seems to be more interesting than the ultra-rich adjusting their wealth strategies.",

From what I have read, their motives were a mixture of civic duty, social networking, and economic self-interest. With changes in the landscape of cities (huge development of suburbs and exurbs) and economic life, incentives to connect with a specific community decreased. Consider how many businesses aren't connected to a particular community and actually have business models that require low civic attachment.\n\nGoing to your example of McDonald's, their strategy in the US requires continual growth in suburbs to create more locations. This is at odds with community development, which requires a certain amount of density around a core for citizens to build a sense of civic identity. \n\nThe book Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community looks at this from the individual level.",
